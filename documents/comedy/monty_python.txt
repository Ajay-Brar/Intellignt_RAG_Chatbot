Monty Python were a British surreal comedy group who created the sketch comedy television show "Monty Python's Flying Circus," which first aired in 1969. The group consisted of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.

Their comedy is often characterized by its absurdity, satirical nature, and stream-of-consciousness structure. They frequently parodied British life, bureaucracy, and historical figures.

In addition to their television series, the group also created several successful films, including "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" (1975), "Life of Brian" (1979), and "The Meaning of Life" (1983). The "Dead Parrot Sketch," "The Ministry of Silly Walks," and "The Spanish Inquisition" are among their most famous sketches.
