Pythons are a family (Pythonidae) of nonvenomous snakes found in Africa, Asia, and Australia. Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. Pythons are constrictors; they kill their prey by squeezing it until it suffocates.

Most pythons are ambush predators, meaning they lie in wait for prey to come close before striking. They have heat-sensing pits on their snouts that allow them to detect warm-blooded prey, even in the dark.

The Ball Python is one of the most popular pet snakes due to its relatively small size and docile temperament. In the wild, they are native to West and Central Africa and spend most of their time on or under the ground. Their diet consists primarily of small rodents.
